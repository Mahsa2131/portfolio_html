<h1>Hello, my name is Mahsa.</h1>
<p>I recently graduated from Linköping University, where I focused on UX design. My background is a bit of a mix—I’ve done everything from jewelry design to consulting and teaching. It’s given me a different way of looking at design, always thinking about how to make things better for the people using them.</p>

<p>I’m the kind of person who’s always thinking of new ideas. Whether I’m working on a project or just going about my day, I love coming up with creative ways to solve problems or make things easier. And I really pay attention to the details—it’s part of what drives me in my work.</p>

<p>Outside of design, I’m all about nature and animals, which is why I’ve chosen to be vegetarian. Traveling is a big inspiration for me too; it helps me see the world (and design) from fresh perspectives. When I’m not working, I’m usually watching movies, reading, or just enjoying a bit of downtime.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio! Feel free to explore my work, and if you’d like to collaborate, I’d love to hear from you.</p>
